# Routing.js #

Routing.js is a lightweight, client-side routing library that allows you to create "single page" applications using Hashbangs and/or HTML5 pushState.

# Features #
* Lightweight
* Supports the HTML5 History API, the 'onhashchange' method, and graceful degredation
* Supports root routes, fallback methods, paramaterised routes, optional route components (dynamic routes), and Aspect Oriented Programming
* Well Tested (tests available in the `./tests` directory)
* Compatible with all major browsers (Tested on Firefox 3.6, Firefox 4.0, Firefox 5.0, Chrome 9, Opera 11, IE7, IE8, IE9)
* Independant of all third party libraries, but plays nice with all of them

Routing.js is a fork of [PathJS](https://github.com/mtrpcic/pathjs) the primary differences are
* Internal logic for route-matching
* Parameters are returned as objects rather than the simple value from the URL

# Using Routing.js - A Brief Example #

```
function clearPanel(){
    // You can put some code in here to do fancy DOM transitions, such as fade-out or slide-in.
}
    
Routing.map("#/users")
        .to(function(){
            alert("Users!");
        });
    
Routing.map("#/comments")
        .to(function(){
            alert("Comments!");
        })
        .before(clearPanel);
    
Routing.map("#/posts")
        .to(function(){
            alert("Posts!");
        })
        .before(clearPanel);
    
Routing.root("#/posts");
    
Routing.listen();
```


# Running Tests #
To run the tests, simply navigate to the `./tests` folder and open the HTML file in your browser.  Please note that the HTML5 History API is not compatible with the
`file://` protocol.
